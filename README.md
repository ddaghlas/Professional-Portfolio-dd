- I was tasked with building a personal portfolio oage from scratch. This included both front-end and back-end coding that I wrote myself. The portfolio itself is meant to be a beginning concept to showcase my work and coding skills that I will continue to add to throughout the duration of the course. 

- I began by creating the <html> page and added a header with my name and a navigation. The navigation is stationary and provides links for users to click on that will direct them to specific areas of my web page. It includes a link to my resume, contact info (included in the <footer>), an "About Me" paragraph, and a compliation of my deployed web applications. 

- I added styling by using CSS selectors, box models, and variables that allow fuctionality across all machines. I included flex options that allow the information to be displayed no matter the size of the screen.

- Additionally, border styling was added to all images and elements as well as :hover functions that allow the text to change color or opacity when hovered over. 

- This starting model of my portfolio is meant to grow as I grow. In so doing, the application will be updated as my knowledge and projects further throughout the extent of the course.
